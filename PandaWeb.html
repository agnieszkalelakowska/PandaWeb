<p>
The giant panda also known as Mr Panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">South Central China.</a>
</p>
<p> 
It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

Though it belongs to the order <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora">Carnivora</a>, the giant panda is a <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folivore">folivore</a>, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.

	 Bamboo fun facts:<br>
	<p>Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia, being used for building materials, as a food source, and as a versatile raw product. Bamboo has a higher specific compressive strength than wood, brick or concrete, and a specific tensile strength that rivals steel.

Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.

	Red Panda
</h1>
	<p id="redpanda">
		The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
		It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than
		10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and
		inbreeding depression.
	</p>
	<img src="330px-RedPandaFullBody.jpg">
	<p>
		The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front
		legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body, and is somewhat heavier.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary
		animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. It is also called the
		lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear.
